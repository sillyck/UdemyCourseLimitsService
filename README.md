# Spring Boot Microservices Practice Repository

This repository is created as a practice project to learn and implement microservices using Spring Boot. It follows the content and exercises from a Udemy course focused on mastering Spring Boot and Spring Cloud for developing microservices architecture.

## About the Course
The course is offered on Udemy and covers key concepts of microservices, including building RESTful services, using Spring Cloud for service discovery, load balancing, API gateways, and containerization with Docker and Kubernetes.

The course and all related documentation are in English, and the primary objective of this repository is to apply the knowledge gained during the course in a practical, hands-on manner.

## Technologies Used
- **Spring Boot**: Core framework for building RESTful web services.
- **Spring Cloud**: Used for handling distributed systems, such as service discovery and load balancing.
- **Docker**: Containerization for the microservices.
- **Kubernetes**: Orchestration of containerized applications (planned in later sections of the course).

## Progress
This repository is actively updated as I progress through different sections of the course. Each commit represents a step forward in the learning journey, implementing the concepts learned in a practical setting.

## Contributions
This repository is for personal learning purposes, and external contributions are not expected. However, if you'd like to provide feedback or suggestions, feel free to open an issue.
